In Stableford scoring, points are awarded based on how a player's score on each hole compares to the predetermined target score, which is usually the par for the hole. Here's how it typically works:
Net Score: First, you calculate your net score for each hole. This is your gross score (the number of strokes you took to complete the hole) minus your handicap strokes for that hole.
Points Calculation: Once you have your net score, you determine how many points you earn for that hole based on the following criteria:
Eagle or better: 4 points
Birdie: 3 points
Par: 2 points
Bogey: 1 point
Double bogey or worse: 0 points
So, if you scored a gross of 2 on a par 4 hole with a handicap of 0, your net score is also 2. Since you scored 2, which is 2 strokes less than par, you earn 4 points for that hole.
Let's go through your example:
Hole: 1
Par: 4
Gross: 2 (you took 2 strokes to complete the hole)
Since your gross score of 2 is 2 strokes less than the par of 4, you earn 4 points for that hole.
In summary, the points are calculated based on how your score compares to the par for the hole, with adjustments made for handicap strokes.

Default points values are:

0 - Double Bogey or worse
1 - Bogey or one over par
2 - Par
3 - Birdie or one under par
4 - Eagle or two under par
5 - Double Eagle or three under par
6 - Four under par
